-change the use of `std::function<...>` for something like `void (*read)(void *fd, char *buffer, int size);` c style, to make the general thing usable from c
-set help text about commands and stuff, also rework the context actions like zoom and tooltips(like to say on a tooltip when is posible to zoom)
-a lot of things changed so only backend currently working is sdl2 and opengl3
-fix the cmakelist to compile the source for NFD in each platform, and fallback to imgui file dialog if not supported platform.
-fix app freezes when opened NFD
-make zoom and save to image available to any widget
-the pop ups need to be able to resize
-Im starting to depend too much in SDL, check this.
-put a description field in structs representing probabilities calculations, to render it as a tooltip
