-change the use of `std::function<...>` for something like `void (*read)(void *fd, char *buffer, int size);` c style, to make the general thing usable from c
-set help text about commands and stuff, also rework the context actions like zoom and tooltips(like to say on a tooltip when is posible to zoom)
-a lot of things changed so only backend currently working is sdl2 and opengl3
-fix the cmakelist to compile the source for NFD in each platform, and fallback to imgui file dialog if not supported platform.
-fix app freezes when opened NFD
-make zoom and save to image available to any widget
-the pop ups need to be able to resize
-Im starting to depend too much in SDL, check this.
-put a description field in structs representing probabilities calculations, to render it as a tooltip
-find a way to deactivate spdlog on compile time, to not link it or not compile it, or something, in main.cpp there is a try in defines but is not working
-the app crashes when calculating and trying to render the content of ccollapsing header "j indexes for each an..."
-need to set an option to compile console mode on all platforms and compilers
-add a release for mac
-not saving images in linux with wayland
-release in github actions to linux with SDL static, has 15mb size, can be stripped to 5.4, why is not stripped by default, is sdl being compiled in debug?
-in gh actions, whe upload a folder as artifact(collections/), says it is corrupted after download 
-implement error calc as in papaer [1] Discussion
-maybe implement the subproccess to calculate, completely independent, ie not writting directly to the arrays in main app
-the generation of random nuumbers with rand() is not fully uniform, because rand() and module operations, neet to switch for something like a random engine or built in c++ <random> 
-check all arrays passed to functions like `a[256][256]`, seek a better general way to do it, and why the template deduction does not work with `a[][]` and works with `a[][256]`, plus in that case indeed checks the size of the arrays
-fix the use of file containing passwords
-make the wigets resizables, mainly the plots, and mainly when zoomed
-compare the use of plain classic lua and luaJit
-not building in linux
-add test to save image, in linux without xorg not working
-set badge for test on github, and add test to CI of course
-remove the little hack used with collections spdlog and Lua
